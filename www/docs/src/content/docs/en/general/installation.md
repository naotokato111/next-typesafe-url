## Installation

To get started, simply install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install next-typesafe-url
# or
yarn add next-typesafe-url
# or
pnpm add next-typesafe-url
```

_If you don't already have it installed,`zod` is a peer dependency used for type validation you'll also need to have._

```bash
npm install zod
# or
yarn add zod
# or
pnpm add zod
```

#### Now lets get typesafe!
